# Campus Hub (Buy and Sell Books Among University Students)

Campus Hub is a mobile app that allows university students to **buy, sell, and discover books** within their campus community.

University books are often expensive, and Campus Hub bridges the gap by enabling juniors to buy second-hand books from seniors at reasonable prices.

This not only makes education more affordable but also promotes sustainability by reusing books, reducing waste, and indirectly contributing to saving trees.

With simplified book management, AI-powered features, and a seamless user experience, Campus Hub is the go-to platform for campus book trading.
